1. Whetting Your Appetite
	very high level language
	high level data types (flexible arrays and dictionaries)
	Interpreted Language: no compilarion and linking necessary
	emphasizes compactibility and readability
	Extensible: can link to link to C or other language files
	Named after "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
3. Informal Introduction to Python


Math
	>>> 17 / 3
	5.6666666667
	>>> 17 // 3 #floor
	5
	>>> 17 % 3 # remainder
	2
	>>> 5 ** 2 # square
	25
Variables not declared
width = 20


Strings: single or double quotes
Indexed: s[0] for first, s[-1] for last
Immutable: cannot change individual char (must create new string)
Slicing: s[:2] first 2; s[1:] everything but first char [)
	no error if slice too far: word[1000:] -> ''
Length: len(s)

>>> 'spam eggs'
'spam eggs'
>>> 'doesn\'t' #cancel '
"doesn't"
"""\
Multiline String:
	can get rid of leading return with \
	after initial triple-quote
"""
concatecate strings with +
'Py' + 'thon'

Printing
print() #ends with \n new line


Lists
Indexing list[1]
Slicing list[2:] [)
Concatecation with +
Mutable: can change individual item list[2] = 1
list.append(1)

squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


Loops

Fibonacci
a, b = 0,1
while a < 10:
	print(a)
	a, b = b, a+b
